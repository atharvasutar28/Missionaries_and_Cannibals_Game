# Missionaries_and_Cannibals_Game
**Overview**
This repository contains the backend code for the classic “Missionaries and Cannibals” game, implemented in Python. The game involves three missionaries and three cannibals who need to cross a river using a boat that can carry at most two people. The challenge is to ensure that cannibals never outnumber missionaries on either side of the river.

**Features**
**State Representation**: Efficient representation of game states using data structures.
**State Transition**: Functions to handle the movement of missionaries and cannibals across the river.
**Game Logic**: Implementation of game rules to ensure valid moves and prevent illegal states.

**Contributing**
